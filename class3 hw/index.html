        <h2>Things you need to know.</h2>
        
        <p> <b>Beautiful Nepal</b> is a land of friendly and engaging people, where deities mingle with mortals and magnificent temples, monasteries and historical monuments can be found at almost every turn. This is the home of Sagarmatha “Goddess Mother of the World”, the iconic Mount Everest, and her snow-capped counterparts making up the weather-beaten Himalayas.

        From eight of the fourteen tallest mountains in the world to the flourishing Terai plains of Jhapa, you will be forgiven for having your camera glued to your hands at all times. To take in the wonders of the Himalayas, we recommend travelling to Dhulikhel , one of the most popular destinations to view this chain of giants. Nepal’s startling beauty is at its best in Pokhara , which has been the subject of many travel writers. Its pristine air, the spectacular backdrop of the snowy peaks of the Annapurna Range and the serene Phewa, Begnas and Rupa Lakes, makes this destination ‘the Jewel of the Himalaya’.</p>
